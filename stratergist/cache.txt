Here are three conservative, 5-year Emergency Fund allocation strategies for a 22-year-old investor contributing ₹10,000 per month. All allocations use instruments whose minimums and unit prices make them feasible at this ticket size.

1. “Maximum Safety” (100% Fixed Income)  
   • 70% → Short-Duration Government Bond Mutual Fund  
     – ₹7,000/month via SIP (min. ₹500). Maturities 1–3 years cap interest-rate risk; sovereign backing ensures principal safety.  
   • 30% → Short-Duration AAA Corporate Bond ETF  
     – ₹3,000/month buying ~12 units (unit price ~₹250). AAA credit rating adds ~0.5–1% yield pickup vs. gilts.  
   Rationale: Zero equity exposure maximizes capital preservation and liquidity (daily NAV redemptions/tradable ETF units).

2. “Income-Plus Lite Growth” (85% Fixed Income, 15% Equity)  
   • 50% → Short-Duration Government Bond Fund  
     – ₹5,000/month via SIP (min. ₹500).  
   • 35% → Short-Duration Corporate Bond Fund (AAA)  
     – ₹3,500/month via SIP (min. ₹500). Corporate bonds yield ~0.7% over gilts.  
   • 15% → Low-Volatility Large-Cap Equity ETF  
     – ₹1,500/month buying ~30 units (unit price ~₹50). Targets low-beta stocks for inflation hedge with limited downside.  
   Rationale: 85% high-quality bonds anchor stability; 15% equity sleeve offers modest upside over 5 years.

3. “Conservative Hybrid” (70% Fixed Income, 30% Hybrid)  
   • 40% → Short-Duration Government Bond Fund  
     – ₹4,000/month via SIP (min. ₹500).  
   • 30% → Ultra-Short Bond ETF  
     – ₹3,000/month buying ~15 units (unit price ~₹200). Ultra-short maturities (<3 days) and yields > savings bank rates.  
   • 30% → Conservative Hybrid Mutual Fund  
     – ₹3,000/month via SIP (min. ₹500). Professionally allocates up to 25% equity (blue-chips) for growth, rest in debt for stability.  
   Rationale: 70% in bonds for capital safety; hybrid fund adds measured equity exposure while maintaining overall conservatism.

Why these mixes?  
• Feasibility: Bond funds allow SIPs from ₹500, ETFs trade in small units (₹200–₹300), equity ETFs permit ₹1,500 allocations.  
• Risk Control: Short maturities limit interest-rate risk; equity or hybrid slices remain capped at 15–30% to respect the conservative profile.  
• Liquidity: Daily redemptions in funds and intraday ETF trading keep money accessible.  

Implementation & Monitoring:  
• Set up SIPs on AMC/broker websites and place recurring monthly ETF buy orders.  
• Rebalance every 6 months if any asset class deviates by >2% from target.  
• Keep a separate cash buffer (e.g., bank sweep or ultra-short liquid fund) for immediate needs (≈5% of total).
